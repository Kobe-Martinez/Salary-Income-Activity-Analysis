# Salary, Income, and Activity Data Analysis

This project delves into three fascinating areas of data analysis: uncovering salary disparities, exploring household income trends, and tracking activity patterns over time. Through powerful visualizations and statistical methods, these scripts transform raw data into compelling stories. Whether itâ€™s revealing gender-based wage gaps, illustrating how income varies across age groups, or mapping time-based activity behaviors, each analysis is crafted to highlight meaningful insights. With a blend of histograms, box plots, and scatter plots enriched by error bars and custom styling, this project provides a fresh perspective on the dynamics of salary equity, economic trends, and human activity.

## Features

- **Salary Disparity Analysis (`salary_analysis.R`)**: 

  - Examines gender-based disparities in starting salaries and salaries in 1977
    
  - Generates histograms and box plots to visualize salary distributions by gender
    
  - Computes Hedge's g statistic and confidence intervals to quantify disparities
    
- **Household Income Analysis (`income_analysis.R`)**: 

  - Analyzes median household income data by age groups
    
  - Creates a scatter plot showing income distributions and associated margins of error
    
  - Visualizes survival trends through line graphs for males and females
 
- **Activity Trend Analysis (`activity_analysis.R`)**: 

  - Processes activity datasets using start and stop times with time bins
    
  - Analyzes activity trends to uncover time-based patterns
    
  - Outputs preliminary analysis results to the console
      

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Data**:
   
   - Place the required files (codes.csv, atusact_2019.dat) in the working directory

2. **Run the Scripts**:
   
   - Execute the following scripts in RStudio or an R environment:
       - `salary_analysis.R`
       - `income_analysis.R`
       - `activity_analysis.R`
   
3. **Generated Outputs**:
   
    - `salary_analysis.R`: Visualizations of salary distributions and wage gaps
    - `income_analysis.R`: Plots median household income with error bars
    - `activity_analysis.R`: Activity trends results are displayed in the console for analysis or adaptation into plots
     

## Code Structure

- **salary_analysis.R**:
  
  - Uses salary data to analyze disparities by gender
    
  - Produces histograms and box plots for starting salaries and 1977 salaries
 
  - Calculates statistical measures like Hedge's g and confidence intervals
    
- **income_analysis.R**:
  
   - Creates a scatter plot showing median household income by age group
 
   - Includes error bars to visualize uncertainties
 
   - Defines a custom dataset for median household income by age group
     
   - Includes error bars to visualize uncertainties
     
   - Outputs the visualization as a high-quality PDF
 
   - Uses custom styling for legends, axis labels, and titles
 
- **activity_analysis.R**:
  
   - Analyzes activity data based on start and stop times
     
   - Groups data into time bins for trend analysis
     
   - Outputs analysis to the console, adaptable for visualizations
     

## Requirements

- R programming environment (preferably RStudio)
  
- Required R packages:
     
           - `RColorBrewer`

           - `GISTools`

           - `Sleuth3` (for salary analysis)

## File Output

- **PDF Outputs**:

  - `salary_analysis.pdf`: Histograms and box plots of salary distribution
    
  - `income_analysis.pdf`: Scatter plot showing household income distribution
    
- **Console Outputs**:

  - `activity_analysis.R`: Activity trends grouped by time bins
